in the deployed version it doesnt work with localhost:3000
but in the local version it doesnt work with the url: https://countries-stabjana.onrender.com:3000

changing the settings are here:
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/fxiwabepasidehipxvkr/auth/url-configuration
(in supa base - url-configuration)

and checking from the google authentication:
https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/clients/810080326278-cl57q9g4fghnn5jm3vtbshne4flq17lo.apps.googleusercontent.com?inv=1&invt=Absnlw&project=countries-full-stack-project
(google console)

now the current settings are serving the deployed page but not localhost:3000 anymore.
